  # This prefix will be added in front of every user-supplied request.  This is useful for
  # setting up a 'character' for the bot to play.  Alternatively, this can be set with the
  # OOBABOT_PERSONA environment variable.
  persona:

  # Path to a file containing a persona.  This can be just a single string, a json file in
  # the common "tavern" formats, or a yaml file in the Oobabooga format.  With a single
  # string, the persona will be set to that string.  Otherwise, the ai_name and persona will
  # be overwritten with the values in the file.  Also, the wakewords will be extended to
  # include the character's own name.
  #   default:
  persona_file: /config/Bot.yaml

  # One or more words that the bot will listen for. The bot will listen in all discord
  # channels it can access for one of these words to be mentioned, then reply to any
  # messages it sees with a matching word. The bot will always reply to @-mentions and
  # direct messages, even if no wakewords are supplied.

  # Discord to be no more than once per this many seconds.  This does not guarantee that
  # updates will be sent this fast.  Only that they will not be sent any faster than this
  # rate.  This is useful because Discord has a rate limit on how often you can send
  # messages, and if you exceed it, the updates will suddenly become slow.  Example: 0.2
  # means we will send updates no faster than 5 times per second.
  #   default: 0.7
  stream_responses_speed_limit:

  # Adds a limit to the number of channels the bot will post unsolicited messages in at the

  # receiving an unsolicited message.  The bot will still respond to @-mentions and wake
  # words in any channel it can access.  Set to 0 to disable this feature.
  #   default: 3
  unsolicited_channel_cap:

  # If set, the bot will not reply to any messages that do not @-mention it or include a
